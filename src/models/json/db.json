      "description": "Corcomroe Abbey is beautifully situated on the edge of the rocky hills of the Burren. It was founded for Cistercian monks around 1195 as a daughter house of the Abbey at Inisloughnaght, Co. Tipperary. The church was constructed in the early 13th century and consists of a nave with an aisle on the south side. It appears that it was intended to construct a similar aisle on the north side of the nave, but this may never have been completed, perhaps due to lack of funds. At the east end is a presbytery or chancel with a decorated ribbed vault lit by narrow lancet windows. There is a north and south transept, each with a single chapel. Where the presbytery and transepts meet there are several crossing arches that feature capitals with some wonderful carvings of human heads and flowers, including poppies, lily-of-the valleys and lotus. In the chancel is highly decorated sedilia and the effigy tomb of Conor O’Brien (d. 1268), king of the ancient territory of Thomond and descendant of the founders and benefactors of the abbey.

      "description": "This 13th century Franciscan friary, founded by the O'Briens, of Thomond who once ruled much of north Munster, has numerous 15th/16th century sculptures carved in the local hard limestone. A carved image of St. Francis displaying the stigmata is evident in the nave. He carries a cross staff and wears the Franciscan habit. Under the south arch of the tower, an elaborate tracery canopy of the late 15th century was perhaps part of an ornate tomb.  The corbels supporting this are carved on one side with a bishop and, on the other, the Virgin & Child. An arch between the nave and transept bears, in a niche, an image of \"Ecce Home\" or \"Christ's Pity\". His hands are bound and tokens of the crucifixion are arranged about. The magnificent east window, with its five tall, narrow lancets, lights the chancel.  The chancel once contained several royal and aristocratic tombs, among those remaining at the friary are the canopy of the Inchiquin/O' Brien tomb and also the Creagh tomb which incorporates five sculptured passion panels from the much older MacMahon Tomb. Set into the back of this tomb is thirteen carved figures representing Christ and the Apostles, all dating from the mid 15th century. The visitor to Ennis Friary can also see the sacristy, an impressive structure with ribbed, barrel-vaulted ceiling. After the suppression of the monasteries the Friary became a venue for assize courts and the sacristy was used as a courtroom. Leading out from the sacristy is the cloister area where part of the arcade has been reconstructed.

Scattery has had many invasions down through the centuries; the Vikings invaded during the early 9th century but Brian Boru later recaptured the island.  It is believed that Scattery is a derivation of the Norse word for treasure, which is Scatty.  The main church on the island is Teampall Naomh Mhuire (Cathedral of Saint Mary), situated next to the round tower.  Scattery for a time in the 12th century administered to a diocese.  There is an effigy of a bishop's head on the outside of the east window of the Cathedral believed to be that of St. Senan.  The holy well, called Tobar Sinean, beside the round tower was of great reverence and respect by the islanders.  It was also associated with a pattern held on St. Senan's Feast Day on 8th March.  St. Senan is believed to have died in the year 544 and is reputed to be buried in St. Senan's Bed beside Temple Senan a small 12th Century Romanesque church.  An exhibition of the history of the island is housed in the visitor reception building, which is situated near the pier.

It is unusual in terms of the arrangement of its enclosing banks and ditches and the presence of a stone-lined entrance passageway within the inner bank. The size and complexity of its construction indicate that around AD 1000 this fort was the homestead of person of some importance, perhaps a local chieftain. The ringfort consists of a substantial bank that is surrounded in turn by a small ditch, a small bank and a large outer ditch. The diameter of the inner enclosure is 42m while the overall diameter of the fort is 75m. The massive inner bank was originally stone-faced on both sides and traces of this can still be seen in places around its circumference. The stone-lined entrance is unique in earthen ringforts, although similar constructions are known in the Irish stone forts. The passage was covered by a series of eight large stone lintels. As there was no causeway across the outer ditch leading to the entrance, there may have been a wooden bridge here providing access.

The townland name probably means Cill na RÃ³mhÃ¡n, â€˜Church of the Romansâ€™, and may refer to a group of monks who adopted the Roman method of calculating Easter in this area some time before AD 630. The church itself is long gone and the main feature at the site is a monument known as the â€˜The Bantry Pillar Stoneâ€™. This stone is probably the shaft of a high cross, perhaps dating to the 8th or 9th century. On the northwest face is a depiction of St Paulâ€™s visit to St Antony in the Egyptian desert. In the panel above is a cross with squares at its crossing and terminals. Next there is a figure wearing a long robe with his hands raised in prayer. The uppermost panel is decorated with ribbon interlace. The southwest face is dominated by the famous â€˜Bantry Boatâ€™. Within the boat is an individual manning the steering oar, four oarsmen and probably two other individuals near the prow. A cross rises from the boat at the stern. The boat itself is probably a skin-covered currach similar to those still in use in Kerry and Galway. Near the high cross shaft are four short stone pillars that once formed the corner-posts of a shrine, which probably marked the grave of the founder of this church or some other individual who was revered as a saint.

      "description": "Drombeg stone circle is dramatically situated on a rocky terrace with sweeping views over farmland to the Atlantic Ocean. Drombeg is perhaps the finest example of a distinctive series of stone circles found in Cork and Kerry. Stone circles were places of ritual and ceremony in the later Bronze Age period (c. 1500 BC - 600 BC) and were usually associated with human burial. Also at the site is a fulacht fiadh or prehistoric cooking site.  Stone circle - At Drombeg the seventeen stones are symmetrically arranged so that one of the stones (the axial stone) is set on its side and placed directly opposite a pair of tall stones (the portal stones) that form the entrance to the circle. The stones reduce in height from the portals to the axial stone which has two shallow cup marks carved on its upper surface. In common with many stone circles in the region, the axis of the circle (i.e., the line extending through the entrance across the top of the axial stone) is orientated north-east / south-west. At the winter solstice (21st December) the sun sets at a point on the horizon aligned with this axis. This marks of the shortest day of the year in Ireland. Excavations undertaken in 1957 revealed a central pit that contained a pottery vessel covering the cremated remains of a youth. Radiocarbon dating has placed the burial in the period c. 1100-800 BC.  Fulacht fiadh - Very close to the stone circle are the remains of two hut sites and a fulacht fiadh (ancient cooking place). The fulacht fiadh consists of a stone-lined trough with a nearby hearth and well. Water in the trough would have been heated by rolling in stones heated by fire in the hearth. Experiments have shown that in about 18 minutes, 70 gallons (318 litres) of cold water could be brought to the boil in this way. Meat was then cooked in the water, which remained sufficiently hot for almost 3 hours. Alternative suggested uses for fulachtaí fia are ritual bathing, as well as industrial activities such as dyeing and even brewing.

      "description": "The ancient church of Drumlane overlooks Derrybrick Lough, one of the many lakes of Cavan. Drumlane was an important early church site associated with St Aidan or Maedhóg, who is also associated with Ferns, Co. Wexford. During the 12th century it became a house of Augustinian canons. The surviving structures consist of a round tower and a medieval church. The round tower dates from the late 11th or early 12th century. It survives to about 11.5m in height and is built in two different forms of masonry. The base was very well-built using squared blocks, whereas the rest of the tower has been constructed with rubble masonry. This may simply reflect a cost-cutting exercise on behalf of the builders after reviewing the cost of the base. The earlier church at the site was entirely replaced by a large medieval building. The west doorway is 13th century in date, but was reconstructed in the 15th century when a carved head of a bishop was also added. There is another carved head over the south doorway, and three more over the exterior of the east window. Drumlane was a burial place of the local Gaelic lords, the O’Reillys, in late medieval times, and the remains of tomb niches in the church date from this period. A decorative metalwork shrine, called the Breac Maedhóg, now in the National Museum of Ireland, was kept here in medieval times and housed relics of a number of saints including Maedhóg.

      "description": "Known as the ‘Browneshill dolmen’, because it is sited on a hill on which sits the former estate house of the Browne family, the remains of this megalithic tomb are well-preserved and the chamber faces down slope to the east. It consists of a massive granite roofstone resting on two upright portal stones with a ‘doorstone’ between them. A fourth stone stands beside them and may indicate the remains of some form of facade. The west end of the roofstone rests on a prostrate stone which could be interpreted as a collapsed backstone. There is no visible trace of a surrounding mound around the structure and the interior ground level of the chamber area is slightly lower than the surrounding field surface. The roofstone is exceptionally large measuring just over 6 metres long by almost 4.50 metres wide and 2 metres thick: it is estimated to weigh at least 100 tons. The monument dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC and was built by the earliest farming communities to inhabit the island of Ireland.

      "description": "The original castle at Rathfarnham dates back to the Elizabethan period and was built for Archbishop Adam Loftus, an ambitious Yorkshire clergyman, who came to Ireland as chaplain to the Lord Deputy and quickly rose to become Archbishop of Dublin, Lord Chancellor of Ireland and was closely involved in the establishment of Trinity College. The castle with its four flanker towers is an excellent example of the fortified house in Ireland. In the late 18th century, the house was remodelled on a splendid scale employing some of the finest architects of the day including Sir William Chambers and James 'Athenian' Stuart. The collection includes family portraits by Angelica Kauffman (1741-1807), Sir Peter Lely (1618-1680), and Hugh Douglas Hamilton (1740-1808).  Rathfarnham Castle welcomes you to the Berkeley Costumes and Toy Collection at Rathfarnham Castle.  Fashion and playthings offer a fascinating insight into social history. Like vernacular architecture, furniture and furnishings, clothes and toys are the physical evidence of lives lived and those lives have something to tell us. The installation by the OPW of the Berkeley Costume and Toy Collection in the magnificent setting of Rathfarnham Castle brings the historic interiors to life and enables this unique collection to be enjoyed by a greater audience.  The Berkeley Costume and Toy Collection is an exquisite collection of 18th and 19th century toys, dolls and costumes. The collection began as a private passion in Co.Wexford over twenty years ago by Irish artist and collector Countess Ann Griffin Bernstorff. The collection was gathered together over many decades from her own family trunks and from auctions and donations. Displayed in the elegant rooms of Rathfarnham Castle and covering a period of some 80 years from 1740 - 1820, the exhibits range from rare and delicate artefacts to simple and robust playthings, and everyday garments of the past many of which were once owned by Irish families.

Travers was Master of the Ordnance and a Groom of the Chamber to the King.  During the Cromwellian period the castle was granted to General Edmund Ludlow, Cromwell’s Master of the Horse in Ireland, and one of the signatories of the death warrant of Charles I. We know from early paintings that this was a very large castle with a number of buildings, though many of these have long since disappeared. Today the castle consists of the original gatehouse with a high vault overhead and a large three-storey tower that formed one side of a large hall that has disappeared.

The site was excavated in 1953. The kerbstones that formerly retained the stone cairn had been removed, but the sockets of these stones were found during the excavations.  The burial gallery is aligned NE-SW and is no longer roofed.  The gap between two stones forming the entrance at the SW end of the gallery is very narrow and was clearly intended to restrict entrance into the burial gallery. The burial gallery was divided by a stone into two chambers, i.e., a front chamber and the main chamber.  The long walls of the chamber were formed by three parallel rows of stones set on end. This type of tomb is believed to have been constructed at the beginning of the Bronze Age in Ireland, around 2500 BC. Several hundred years after its construction, people returned to the wedge tomb at Kilmashogue and inserted three stone cists that were found to contain Bronze Age pottery.

In the early 15th century the friary consisted of a long church comprising a nave and chancel, with a cloister and domestic buildings to the north. The tower was added later in the 15th century, as well as an aisle and a transept to the south of the church. Near the door at the west end of the church, is a tomb featuring wonderful carvings of St. John the Evangelist, St. Louis of Toulouse, The Virgin, St. John the Baptist, St. James of Compostela and St. Denis of Paris beneath a spectacular canopy of ‘flamboyant’ tracery. Above the canopy are two small figures, one of St. Francis and the other of a Bishop. The tomb dates to the early 16th century, although is not known whom it commemorates. The friary was officially dissolved in 1541 and in 1596 was occupied by English troops for a time. However, in 1617 it was claimed that the buildings were intact and still in use, with a community of six friars.

In the chancel are a triple sedilia and an elaborate tomb niche. The wonderful east window of the chancel dates from the 15th century, but the remains of the 13th century windows are still visible. Under the arches of the tower are carvings of animal heads, and high up on the tower are projecting gargoyles that channelled rainwater away from the roof. To the south of the church are the square area of the former cloister and the remains of some of the associated buildings. In the late 16th century the friary became the property of the de Burgo (Burke) family. Please note that many of these monuments may be on private land and may not be publicly accessible.

      "description": "Athenry is one of the most notable medieval walled towns surviving in Ireland, owing its foundation to Meiler de Bermingham who built his castle there c.1250.  The oldest part of the castle is the hall-keep.  It is a large rectangular building originally containing only a hall at first-floor level and dark storerooms at ground level.  For extra strength the lower part of the wall slopes out to form what is called a batter.    The only original entrance was at first-floor level and would have been reached by an external wooden stairs similar to the present reconstruction.  This gave direct access to the hall, the official and ceremonial reception room of the castle, where the lord received guests and tenants and presided over the manor court.  Heat was probably provided originally by a brazier in the centre of the hall, with the smoke exiting through a louver or opening in the roof directly above.  The garderobe or toilet is located diagonally across from the main entrance to the hall.  The fine carving on the exterior of the doorway and on the inner side of two of the window openings bears witness to the importance of the hall.  The capitals in both cases are carved with floral motifs in local style, known as the  \"School of the West\", transitional between Romanesque and Gothic.  Dating from the late 12th and early 13th centuries, this style can be found at the abbeys of Cong, Ballintubber and Boyle.     The battlements are original 13th century work with tall arrow loops or slits in the solid sections or merlons.  In the 15th century, these parapets were incorporated into steeply pitched gables at the north and south ends, for a new roof at this level.  Parts of the original enclosure wall of the castle survive.  Please note that many of these monuments may be on private land and may not be publicly accessible.

Garret Mór, known as the Great Earl of Kildare, governed Ireland in the name of the King of England from 1487 - 1513 and under his son, Garret Og the 9th Earl, the Castle became the centre of political power and culture. The original Keep, constructed c. 1203, was one of the largest of its kind in Ireland. Early in the 17th century the castle was remodelled and the main focus of the Castle shifted from the original Keep to the buildings in the east of the grounds. It was vested in the State in 1991 and a programme of restoration commenced in February 2000. There is an exhibition in the Keep on the history of the castle and the family.

The castle consists of a single tower, over 24m in height. During the rebellion of Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond the castle was fortified with a garrison of fifty Irish and sixteen Spanish soldiers, who had arrived in Ireland in 1579. The castle was attacked during Easter 1580 by government forces under Sir William Pelham, Lord Justice of Ireland. Tradition recounts the siege as seeing one of the first uses of artillery fire-power in Kerry. On the first day Pelham ordered troops to cross to the sea-wall, where they were pinned down by gunfire and had boulders thrown at them from the battlements. On the second day government reinforcements arrived. The castle walls cracked under the impact of a few shots of cannon and the west wall collapsed, crushing many inside. The remaining occupants of the castle were subsequently put to death. Please note that many of these monuments may be on private land and may not be publicly accessible.

      "description": "Approaching Kells Priory today, with its walls and castellated towers, it looks more like a fortified settlement than a religious house. The priory was founded in 1193 for Augustinian Canons by Geoffrey fitz Robert, seneschal of Leinster. It became a wealthy establishment and by the time of its suppression by Henry VIII in 1540 it held 2,300 acres of land in Co. Kilkenny and received the tithes from 42 churches and chapels. The main priory enclosure is situated on the banks of the King’s River and contains extensive remains of the priory buildings, including the church and the domestic ranges around a square cloister to the south. The church was extended and altered many times between 1200 and 1540. Excavations in the 1970s showed how the church was embellished with decorated floor tiles, wall paintings and painted glass in the windows. The building to the north of the chancel was a Lady Chapel, while the tower attached to its south side was the residence of the prior in late medieval times. The nave had an aisle on its north side and a tall bell tower at its north-west corner, only the lower storey of which survives. The east range of the cloister had several rooms, including the community’s chapter house, while the first-floor room in the south range was a large refectory (dining hall). Around the mid 15th century the priory strengthened the precinct wall and added a large outer enclosure with a number of tower houses for the tenants of the priory on its perimeter. In medieval times a road ran through this outer enclosure.  Please note that many of these monuments may be on private land and may not be publicly accessible.

During the time of the Penal Laws, Skellig Michael and Little Skellig became a haven for many Catholics whose beliefs and rights were being suppressed. The largest of the Skelligs is Skellig Michael (Sceilg Mhichil) and was home to one of the earliest monastic settlements in Ireland. These monks of St. Fionan's monastery led simple lives and lived in stone, beehive shaped huts. They would descend the 670 steps early every morning and fish for the morning's breakfast. They would spend most of the day praying in the church, tending to their gardens and studying. These huts, which were round on the outside and rectangular on the inside, were carefully built so that no drop of rain ever entered between the stones. The monks left the island in the thirteenth century and it became a place of pilgrimage. There is a fantastic wealth of bird life on and around the Skelligs, especially puffins in late spring and gannets on the small Skellig where 23,000 pairs nest on every available ledge making it the second largest gannet colony in the world.

      "description": "The Rock of Dunamase is a spectacular natural feature visible in the landscape of Co. Laois.  It takes its name from the Irish Dún Másc, meaning the ‘Fort of Masc’. Dunamase was the seat or fort of the ancient Irish kings of Laois.  In 845 the fortress or dún on top of the rock was attacked by a Viking army from Dublin, who plundered several other sites in the region.  Nothing of this early fortress can be seen today today, but what does survive is one of the most spectacular Anglo-Norman fortifications in the country. The castle keep or hall located on the summit of the rock may have been built about 1200 by Meiler fitz Henry. The courtyard area around the castle was defended by a curtain wall that follows the cliff edge of the rock outcrop. This area can only be accessed through a gateway called the barbican that crosses over a rock cut ditch. These outer fortifications were probably built between 1208-1210 by William Marshal the Elder, Lord of Leinster. Around 1320, Dunamase was attacked and captured by local Gaelic forces under the command of Leysagh O’More. The castle appears to have been abandoned in the second half of the 14th century.  Dunamase was reused during the Irish Confederate Wars of the 1640s and large parts of the castle were demolished by Cromwellian troops after a siege in 1650.

The friary was founded for the Observant Order of Friars by Owen O’Rourke and his wife Margaret O’Brien in 1508, making it the last medieval monastery to be established in Ireland. The friary consists of a church, cloister and a number of domestic buildings. The church has a nave, chancel, tower and south transept. The cloister is relatively intact and on one of the pillars is a carving of St. Francis. On the eastern side of the cloister there are three rooms including a sacristy. In the north wing there is a refectory and kitchen. The upper floors would have housed the dormitories of the friars. The friary was accidentally burned in 1536 and suppressed five years later. However, it continued in use for several years, but by 1590, Sir Richard Bingham, Governor of Connaught, burned its woodwork and used the buildings for stables.

      "description": "Located to the south-west of the Cooley Mountains near the lower slopes of Black Mountain, Proleek portal tomb is one of the best-known and most iconic megalithic tombs in Ireland. The tomb comprises three upright stones supporting an impressively large capstone delicately poised more than 2m above the ground and reputed to weigh as much as 40 tonnes. The tomb is classified as a portal tomb on account of the two large, upright stones forming a portal or entrance, which faces north-west. In its original condition the tomb may have been surrounded or partially surrounded by a stone mound or cairn, of which there is now no trace. Constructed over 5,000 years ago in the Neolithic period, it is likely that the tomb contains burials and cremated remains of members of the earliest farming communities on the Cooley Peninsula. In more recent times the Proleek tomb was known locally as the ‘Giant’s Load’, allegedly on account of the similarity of its silhouette to a man stooped over from carrying a large load on his back. The small stones lying on the capstone relate to a local tradition that if you successfully land three stones on top you will be married before the end of the year!  Nearby are the remains of another megalithic tomb classified as a wedge tomb. Dating from the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age period, c. 4000 years ago, the Proleek wedge tomb is one of only two known examples in Co. Louth. Wedge tombs are so called on account of their characteristic shape; in plan the long burial chamber or gallery narrows from front to rear, while in profile the tomb slopes downwards from front to rear. In its original state the tomb would have been covered with a series of roofstones. Only one roofstone now remains, covering the eastern end of the tomb. The tomb is aligned roughly west-east, with a large stone closing the entrance at the west. There are indications that originally there may have been a stone facade at the western end, flanking either side of the entrance, but today only one stone survives. It is likely that the tomb would have been covered or partially covered with a mound of stones, but there is no trace of this today.

The early 15th century church consists of the nave, chancel and north transept. The chancel has a simple five-light traceried east window. Most Franciscan friaries had their cloisters located to north of the church, whereas the cloister at Askeaton is unusual in that it was built to the south. The cloister is one of the finest examples surviving in Ireland and has a number of unusual features, including a sundial and a carving of St. Francis with stigmata. Along one side of the cloister is the former kitchen of the friary, with an intact fireplace and oven. Also attached to the cloister is a fine example of a refectory where the friars had their meals. The friary was plundered by Sir Nicholas Malby, Governor of Connaught in 1579 who came to assist in quashing a rebellion in Limerick. The friary was subsequently revived and was used by the friars as late as 1714.  Please note that many of these monuments may be on private land and may not be publicly accessible.

The church is long and narrow, typical of Augustinian churches.  There is a fine east window, with carved human heads on the wall outside.  There are a number of fine windows in the south wall, which is crowned with battlements, suggesting that the building was partly fortified.

      "description": "Standing tall and proud on the summit of Skreen Hill, overlooking the more famous Hill of Tara, is the site of an ancient church associated with St Columba. From the hill there are spectacular views of the plains of the ancient kingdom of Meath. In the 1170s the lands at Skreen were granted to Adam de Feypo, an Anglo-Norman knight originally from Herefordshire. His brother Thomas joined the Cistercian Abbey of St Mary’s in Dublin, and in 1185 Adam granted the church at Skreen to St Mary’s. Adam de Feypo died about 1190 and was buried in St Mary’s Abbey. Little is known of the former Columban church at Skreen, and what survive today are the remains of a large medieval parish church. The most conspicuous feature is the massive bell tower at the west end of the large church. Above the south doorway is a carving of a bishop that probably dates to the 14th century. In the graveyard is a medieval stone cross featuring the crucifixion. Please note that many of these monuments may be on private land and may not be publicly accessible.

      "description": "The town of Clones owes its origins to an ancient church founded here by St Tighearnach who reputed to have been baptised by St Brigid at Kildare. Apparently St Tighearnach (d. 550) was granted these lands by a swineherd. Clones was the principal ecclesiastical site in the ancient territory of Dartraighe. In 836 many churches in the region, including Clones, were raided by the Vikings. In 850 a man by the name of Cairell, who was the son of a local king, was killed in front of the door of the oratory of Tighearnach at Clones. In 1010 Flaitbhertach Ua Cethenen, described as ‘a distinguished bishop’ was mortally wounded by the men of the neighbouring territory of Breifne, and afterwards died in his own church at Clones. The remains at Clones consist of a round tower, a 12th century sarcophagus, a decorated high cross known as the Market Cross in the Diamond and St Peter and Paul’s church.  The cross has stood in its present form for several centuries at its present location in the Diamond, the old market square of the town. In fact, this cross comprises the head and shaft of two different high crosses. The north face of the cross is decorated with biblical depictions of the Adoration of the Magi, the wedding feast of Cana and the multiplication of loaves and fishes. On the cross head is the Crucifixion. On the south face the scenes include the Adam and Eve under the arching apple tree, the sacrifice of Isaac and Daniel in the Lion’s Den. On the head of the cross Daniel in the Lion’s Den is depicted again, a further indication that the cross and shaft belong originally to two different crosses. The cross belongs to a small group of crosses found elsewhere in Ulster, namely at Armagh as well as Arboe and Donaghmore, Co. Tyrone.

The ancient church at Seir Kieran is associated with St Ciarán the elder, who is supposed to have spent 30 years in Rome studying the scriptures. In ancient times the church was a burial place of the kings of the ancient kingdom of Ossory. Today pilgrims continue to carry out stations at St Kieran’s Well and St. Kieran’s Bush & Stone on his feastday (March 5th). Within the graveyard is the base of a 9th century high cross which features carvings of biblical scenes, such as ‘Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden’. Sometime before 1170 Seirkieran became a house of Augustinian canons and shortly after this date the priory church of St. Ciarán was built. The walls of this church form the northern boundary of the graveyard. The foundations of an earlier round tower can be seen on the external northwest angle of the priory ruins. The priory was dissolved in 1552 and sometime later the church was fortified when a small circular gun-tower was added on to the southeast angle. In 1844 the Church of Ireland built the present church, in which are housed a stone cross and some early cross slabs that were found in the graveyard. A sheela na gig from the site is now in the National Museum of Ireland.  When setting out to visit monuments please ensure that you wear appropriate footwear and clothing.

It was built to a design similar to contemporary royal castles such as Harlech Castle in Wales. Roscommon Castle was commenced by the Crown in 1269 and was originally occupied by Robert de Ufford, Lord Justice of Ireland. In its early days it was attacked and burned several times by Gaelic forces before construction was completed in 1290. These works included the construction of a curtain wall around the castle and a large twin towered gatehouse. During the 15th century possession moved between various factions of the O’Conor’s. In 1577 the castle was granted to Sir Nicholas Malby (Governor of Connaught), who kept a force of 50 foot soldiers stationed within it. Malby transformed the castle into an imposing, four-storey Renaissance-style house. From 1645 to 1652 the castle was occupied by Confederate Catholics, but was dismantled after surrendering to the Cromwellians.

The church had a central tower which, along with the cloister, no longer survives. The original 13th century lancet windows are still preserved in the south wall of the nave. The original windows at the east and west ends of the church were replaced in the 15th century with larger windows. On his death in 1265 Felim O’Conor was interred in the friary and his tomb was covered by an effigial slab. The effigy was carved in limestone between 1290 and 1300 and is one of only two Irish royal effigies surviving from this period. The effigy is now supported by a later 15th century tomb carved with the figures of eight soldiers in mail armour with swords and pointed helmets.

This Franciscan friary was founded in the 13th century by Donnchad Móir Ó Briain, King of Thomond (1210-1242). Historical evidence suggests that in 1471 a new church was constructed at the site, but that the following year it was destroyed by fire. The buildings that survive today date from this period. The church consists of a nave and chancel, separated by a tall bell-tower. In the chancel is a double piscina for washing liturgical vessels. Beside the doorway in the north wall of the chancel is a stoup which contained holy water that would have served the friars entering the church from the sacristy which formerly stood to the north. In 1541 the friary was dissolved and later became the property of John Fitzgerald, brother of the Earl of Desmond. In 1569, during a rebellion led by the Earl of Desmond, the abbey was burned by government soldiers led by Sir Humphrey Gilbert, originally from Devon and a half-brother of Sir Walter Raleigh. The following year Fr. Dermot O’Mulrooney and two other friars returned to the friary, but were murdered by government forces.

The various domestic buildings and the cloister that once formed part of the complex have disappeared. The tower within the building was constructed in the early 19th century.

      "description": "The ancient church at Aghowle is associated with St Finnian (who died in 549), and he is supposed to have established a church at Aghowle before founding his more famous site at Clonard, Co. Meath.  The name Aghowle derives from the Irish Achadh Abhall, meaning ‘field of the apple tree’.  According to the Life of St Finnian, the Leinster king Muiredach mac Aengusa gave him a field where an apple tree stood, hence the name by which the church was subsequently known.  At the site today there are the remains of a large church built about the middle of the 12th century. The door of the church is in the Romanesque tradition, but its style is unusual and echoes the form of doorways found in earlier Irish churches. There are also two little Romanesque windows at the east end of the church. Near the door of the church stands a granite high cross known as St Finden’s Cross. It is older than the present church ruins and was probably carved in the 10th century. Under the cross is a crude baptismal font, which may be one of the oldest examples in the country.

      "description": "Fore is situated in a marshy valley and takes its name from the Irish word fobhair, meaning a spring or a well. The earliest church at Fore was founded by St. Féichín around AD 630. St. Féichín is said to have died during a great plague in 665 after having fasted against the plague.  Fore was granted to Hugh de Lacy as part of the liberty of Meath in 1172 and about 1180 he built a motte and bailey castle, which is located near the modern village. About this time a Benedictine priory was established in the valley.  The remains at Fore consist of St Feichin’s Church, the Benedictine Priory, two medieval gate ways, two holy wells, St Mary’s medieval parish church, a mausoleum known as the Anchorite’s Cell and a number of 17th century crosses.  St. Feichin’s Church St. Féichín’s Church is a stone church built on the site of the monastery founded by St. Feichín. It is recorded that a church here was burnt down in 816. The surviving remains consist of a nave and chancel building.  The nave, with its projecting side walls, is the oldest part of the church and was probably built in the late 10th or early 11th century. It boasts an impressive doorway at the west end. The massive lintel over the door features an encircled equal-armed cross. At the beginning of the 13th century a chancel was added and a beautiful pointed chancel arch was inserted into the gable of the older church. The original window of the chancel was replaced by a smaller window in the 15th century. Also within the church is a medieval font and within the surrounding graveyard is a plain high cross.  The Benedictine Priory of St. Taurin and St. Feichín Sometimes called Fore Abbey, this is one of only a small number of Benedictine Priories in Ireland. It was founded between 1180 and 1186 by Hugh de Lacy, and was a daughter house of the monastery of St. Taurin at Évreux in Normandy, France. Over the years many of the priors and monks who served here were originally from France. However, in 1448 an act of parliament broke the links with the French mother house and Fore became an independent priory. The priory was eventually suppressed in 1539. The narrow church of the priory was built in the 13th century and features a three-light window at the east end. In the 15th century a four-storey residential tower was added at the west end of the church. Another tower was also constructed over the sacristy. To the south of the church is the cloister, around which are arranged buildings such as the kitchen, refectory, chapter room and dormitories. Near the priory and built into the side of the hill known as Knocknamonaster are the remains of a circular dovecot or columbarium.  Other monuments Overlooking St. Feichín’s Church is a building known as the Anchorite’s Cell. This consists of a 19th century mausoleum of the Grenville-Nugent family. However, the tower attached to the mausoleum is 15th century in date, so the site must be earlier. Between St. Feichín’s Church and the Benedictine Priory are two holy wells (Tobernacogany and Doaghfeighin) and the remains of what appears to be a medieval water mill.   In the 13th century a small borough or town was established at Fore. By the 15th century the town was essentially an Anglo-Norman colony in the midst of Gaelic controlled lands. During this time Fore was repeatedly attacked and as a result the population constructed the two defensive gates that survive today. The present village is a remnant of the medieval town, and within the village are the remains of St Mary’s medieval parish church and several stone wayside crosses that are believed to date to the 17th century.

In the 1170s a new castle was built at the site by the sons of Maurice Fitzgerald, but all trace of this castle has disappeared. It was probably replaced entirely by the stone castle that stands on the site today. About 1224 the present stone castle at Ferns was completed by Earl William Marshal the younger, Lord of Leinster, and in the early years was the stronghold of the Marshal family. Today much of the original castle has disappeared, but it is clear from what remains that this was a very substantial and imposing castle for its time. The castle consisted of a large rectangular block with round corner towers at each of the four angles. Two of these towers survive today, and in the eastern one is a finely preserved chapel for the former residents of the castle. Originally the castle was surrounded by a large moat, large sections of which were cut through solid rock.   Ferns Castle is one of a number of historic sites in Ferns. Others include St. Mary's, a 12th century Augustinian Priory; the remains of a 13th century cathedral, part of which is incorporated into the present Church of Ireland Church; St. Peter's, a small nave and chancel church; and some High Crosses and parts of crosses, which stand in the cathedral grounds.
